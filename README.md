## Overview

###  What is this project?
This Employee Management System is a web-based platform that automates HR-related tasks such as employee registration, attendance tracking, project assignment, and performance review.

###  Why did I build it?
To demonstrate my ability to design a **complete database-driven system** using Python and SQL.  
It shows my skills in **backend logic, data handling, and UI creation** with Streamlit.

###  How does it work?
- Front-end: Streamlit for UI.
- Back-end: MySQL for database management.
- Connection: `mysql-connector-python`.

Admins can log in to manage employee data, and employees can log in to view attendance, request leaves, check performance, and assigned projects.
